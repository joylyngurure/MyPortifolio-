          <p className="text-lg leading-7 text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Hi, I'm <strong>Joylyn Gurure</strong>, a passionate and detail-oriented Junior Software Developer with 7 months of hands-on experience. I specialize in building responsive and dynamic web and mobile applications using modern technologies like React, React Native, and Node.js.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-7 text-gray-300 mb-4">
            I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions. My journey so far has involved working on real-world projects that required collaboration, adaptability, and continuous learning. I'm efficient, a quick learner, and always up for a challenge.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-7 text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Whether it's developing scalable APIs, creating clean UI interfaces, or optimizing performance, I always aim to write clean, maintainable code. I'm currently exploring backend frameworks like NestJS and cloud services to deepen my skills.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-7 text-gray-300 mb-8">
            Outside of coding, Iâ€™m a strong team player who values communication and continuous improvement. I'm excited about the future of tech and always looking for opportunities to grow and contribute.
          </p>
